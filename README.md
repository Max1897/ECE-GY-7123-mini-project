# ECE-GY-7123-mini-project
Current work:  
1. Using the offered [repository](https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar/blob/master/main.py) to walk through the architecture.   
2. Adjust the project into a main file that calling all the functions.   
3. Adjust Resnet model to gain progress.

Other to-dos:  
1. adding path to model. As [this](https://github.com/mayankpoddar/ResNet/blob/main/project1_model.py) line 53 so that trained model can be kept.
